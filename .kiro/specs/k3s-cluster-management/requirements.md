# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive K3s cluster management repository that serves multiple phases: initial cluster setup, ArgoCD integration, and ongoing cluster administration through GitOps practices. The system will evolve from basic initialization scripts to a full-featured cluster management platform.

## Glossary

- **K3s_Cluster**: A lightweight Kubernetes distribution cluster managed by this system
- **ArgoCD_System**: The GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes applications
- **Cluster_Admin_Repository**: The Git repository containing all cluster configuration and application definitions
- **Initialization_Scripts**: Shell scripts and configuration files used for initial cluster setup
- **Cluster_Operators**: Kubernetes operators that extend cluster functionality (monitoring, networking, storage, etc.)
- **GitOps_Workflow**: The practice of using Git repositories as the source of truth for cluster state
- **Helm_Charts**: Kubernetes package manager templates for deploying applications
- **Bootstrap_Process**: The initial setup sequence that prepares the cluster for GitOps management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to initialize a K3s cluster from scratch, so that I can have a working Kubernetes environment ready for application deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL provision a K3s cluster with all required components.
2. WHEN cluster initialization completes, THE K3s_Cluster SHALL be accessible via kubectl
3. THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL configure cluster networking and storage classes
4. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL validate cluster health before completion
5. WHERE custom configuration is provided, THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL apply the specified settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to install and configure ArgoCD on the cluster, so that I can manage applications and configurations through GitOps practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be deployed to the K3s_Cluster with proper RBAC configuration
2. WHEN ArgoCD installation completes, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be accessible via web interface
3. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be configured to monitor the Cluster_Admin_Repository
4. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL establish initial ArgoCD applications for cluster management
5. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL authenticate users through configured identity providers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want the repository to serve as the single source of truth for cluster state, so that all changes are tracked and can be rolled back if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL contain all cluster configuration as code
2. WHEN changes are committed to the repository, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL detect and apply them
3. THE GitOps_Workflow SHALL maintain audit trails of all cluster modifications
4. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL support rollback to previous configurations
5. WHERE configuration conflicts occur, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL report synchronization status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to install additional cluster operators through the repository, so that I can extend cluster capabilities without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL support Helm_Charts for operator deployment
2. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL manage operator lifecycle through declarative configurations
3. WHEN new operators are added to the repository, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL deploy them automatically
4. THE Cluster_Operators SHALL be configured with appropriate resource limits and monitoring
5. WHERE operator dependencies exist, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL handle installation ordering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps team member, I want the repository structure to be organized and maintainable, so that multiple team members can contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL follow consistent directory structure conventions
2. THE repository SHALL include comprehensive documentation for all components
3. WHEN team members make changes, THE repository SHALL enforce validation through CI/CD pipelines
4. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL separate concerns between infrastructure and application configurations
5. WHERE environment-specific configurations exist, THE repository SHALL organize them clearly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the cluster management system to follow security best practices, so that the infrastructure remains secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K3s_Cluster SHALL be configured with network policies and pod security standards
2. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL use encrypted connections and secure authentication
3. WHEN secrets are required, THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL use proper secret management
4. THE Cluster_Operators SHALL run with minimal required privileges
5. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL apply security hardening configurations
