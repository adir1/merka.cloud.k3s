# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive K3s cluster management repository that serves multiple phases: initial cluster setup, ArgoCD integration, and ongoing cluster administration through GitOps practices. The system will evolve from basic initialization scripts to a full-featured cluster management platform.

## Glossary

- **K3s_Cluster**: A lightweight Kubernetes distribution cluster managed by this system
- **ArgoCD_System**: The GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes applications
- **Cluster_Admin_Repository**: The Git repository containing all cluster configuration and application definitions
- **Initialization_Scripts**: Shell scripts and configuration files used for initial cluster setup
- **Cluster_Operators**: Kubernetes operators that extend cluster functionality (monitoring, networking, storage, etc.)
- **GitOps_Workflow**: The practice of using Git repositories as the source of truth for cluster state
- **Helm_Charts**: Kubernetes package manager templates for deploying applications
- **Bootstrap_Process**: The initial setup sequence that prepares the cluster for GitOps management
- **Cluster_Dashboard**: A web-based interface providing cluster health statistics and application access links
- **Ingress_Controller**: The system component that manages external access to cluster services
- **Service_Routing**: The configuration that defines how external traffic reaches internal services

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to initialize a K3s cluster from scratch, so that I can have a working Kubernetes environment ready for application deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL provision a K3s cluster with all required components.
2. WHEN cluster initialization completes, THE K3s_Cluster SHALL be accessible via kubectl
3. THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL configure cluster networking and storage classes
4. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL validate cluster health before completion
5. WHERE custom configuration is provided, THE Initialization_Scripts SHALL apply the specified settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to install and configure ArgoCD on the cluster, so that I can manage applications and configurations through GitOps practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be deployed to the K3s_Cluster with proper RBAC configuration
2. WHEN ArgoCD installation completes, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be accessible via web interface
3. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL be configured to monitor the Cluster_Admin_Repository
4. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL establish initial ArgoCD applications for cluster management
5. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL authenticate users through configured identity providers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want the repository to serve as the single source of truth for cluster state, so that all changes are tracked and can be rolled back if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL contain all cluster configuration as code
2. WHEN changes are committed to the repository, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL detect and apply them
3. THE GitOps_Workflow SHALL maintain audit trails of all cluster modifications
4. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL support rollback to previous configurations
5. WHERE configuration conflicts occur, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL report synchronization status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to install additional cluster operators through the repository, so that I can extend cluster capabilities without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL support Helm_Charts for operator deployment
2. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL manage operator lifecycle through declarative configurations
3. WHEN new operators are added to the repository, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL deploy them automatically
4. THE Cluster_Operators SHALL be configured with appropriate resource limits and monitoring
5. WHERE operator dependencies exist, THE ArgoCD_System SHALL handle installation ordering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps team member, I want the repository structure to be organized and maintainable, so that multiple team members can contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL follow consistent directory structure conventions
2. THE repository SHALL include comprehensive documentation for all components
3. WHEN team members make changes, THE repository SHALL enforce validation through CI/CD pipelines
4. THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL separate concerns between infrastructure and application configurations
5. WHERE environment-specific configurations exist, THE repository SHALL organize them clearly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the cluster management system to follow security best practices, so that the infrastructure remains secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K3s_Cluster SHALL be configured with network policies and pod security standards
2. THE ArgoCD_System SHALL use encrypted connections and secure authentication
3. WHEN secrets are required, THE Cluster_Admin_Repository SHALL use proper secret management
4. THE Cluster_Operators SHALL run with minimal required privileges
5. THE Bootstrap_Process SHALL apply security hardening configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want a centralized dashboard accessible on port 8080, so that I can monitor cluster health and access all deployed applications from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cluster_Dashboard SHALL be accessible on port 8080 of the K3s_Cluster
2. THE Cluster_Dashboard SHALL display basic cluster health statistics including node status and resource utilization
3. THE Cluster_Dashboard SHALL provide direct links to all deployed applications including ArgoCD and Grafana
4. WHEN new applications are deployed, THE Cluster_Dashboard SHALL automatically discover and display access links
5. THE Cluster_Dashboard SHALL be based on an existing open-source project with custom modifications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want comprehensive ingress routing rules configured, so that all services including ArgoCD, Grafana, and future applications are easily accessible with proper URL routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Ingress_Controller SHALL be deployed and configured as part of the K3s_Cluster setup
2. THE Service_Routing SHALL provide clean URL paths for ArgoCD, Grafana, and the Cluster_Dashboard
3. WHEN new services are deployed, THE Ingress_Controller SHALL support dynamic routing configuration
4. THE Service_Routing SHALL implement SSL termination and secure connections for all exposed services
5. THE Ingress_Controller SHALL integrate with the GitOps workflow for configuration management
